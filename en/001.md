### Hybrid Audio/Vision Solution

The Kendryte K210 combines machine vision and machine hearing to provide even more powerful features. In the application, both the sound source localization and the sound field imaging can be used to assist the machine vision to track the target, and the general target detection can obtain the target's orientation and then assist the machine to perform the beamforming of the source. Additionally, the direction of the person can be obtained by the image transmitted from the camera, so that the microphone array is directed to the person by beamforming. At the same time, the direction of speech can be determined according to the microphone array, and the camera is rotated to point to the person.
